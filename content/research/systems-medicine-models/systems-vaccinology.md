I joined a large consortium studying “systems biology analysis of innate and adaptive responses to vaccination” headed by Emory University researchers. We now have patient response data (phenotype and transcriptional) after vaccination from responders and non-responders for years 2007-12. In a longitudinal study of the human transcriptome from influenza vaccinees across several years, we identified the phenotypic modules that characterize responders and non-responders. We were also able to identify mechanisms that lead to poor vaccination response of the elderly.
