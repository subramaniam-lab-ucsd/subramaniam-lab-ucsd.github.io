In the past few years we have embarked on the very exciting area of diseases of the human brain. In collaboration with Professor Inder Verma at the Salk Institute, we reconstructed the pathways that lead to glioblastoma and identified a key regulator of the pathological process. We were able to demonstrate both in vitro and in vivo through perturbation experiments a key protein that regulates glioma formation. This paper was recently published in Oncogene.

More recently, we have worked extensively on early onset Alzheimer’s disease and have come up with very interesting insights into the mechanisms of AD pathology. The results of our analysis are indeed surprising and may provide a unique insight into several pathologies. Stay tuned…
